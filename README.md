**The digital corner store for real connection.**

Building BRO: Where Guys Actually Connect

I'm 8 weeks away from launching my first consumer app, and I'm building it completely in public.

📱 What is BRO?

BRO is a location-based voice platform that connects guys in real-time based on shared interests and what they're actually into—not profiles, follower counts, or status.

Think: A digital barbershop meets your best group chat.

🎯 The Opportunity:

Professional networking is broken for our generation:
• LinkedIn is for job hunting, not real connection
• WhatsApp groups go silent after a week  
• Coffee meetings take 2 weeks to schedule
• You're surrounded by people but don't know who to actually talk to

We're solving for spontaneous, high-quality connection.

💡 How It Works:

1. Open the app → Pick your vibe (Business, Sports, Tech, Fitness)
2. Get matched with a Bro nearby or globally who's online right now
3. Voice chat, text, or join group "Huddles" (up to 5 people)
4. Post to the Feed: "Launching my SaaS next week, who wants to review?"

Real-time. Real people. Real conversations.

🔒 Quality Control:

• Post-interaction ratings (toxic users auto-banned)
• 16+ verification
• Community moderation
• Premium tier (R30/month) for serious networkers

🛠️ Tech Stack (For the Builders):

• Flutter (iOS + Android from one codebase)
• Supabase (PostgreSQL + real-time + PostGIS for location)
• ZegoCloud (voice infrastructure)
• PayStack/Stripe (payments)

📊 Why I'm Building This:

I've lived in 3 cities in 5 years. Every time I move, I ask the same question:

"Where are the guys who are building, training, and actually doing things?"

BRO is the answer I wish I had.

🌍 The Plan:

• Week 1-4: MVP (Onboarding, Feed, Voice)
• Week 5-8: Beta (100 users in Joburg, CT, Durban)
• Week 9-12: Public launch (South Africa → Global)

I'm sharing everything:
✅ Weekly code updates
✅ User interviews
✅ Revenue numbers
✅ Failures and pivots

🤝 How You Can Help:

• Follow for updates
• Share with guys in your network who'd vibe with this
• DM me if you want beta access (launching in 8 weeks)

Let's build something real.
